Builds ffmpeg from sources including dependencies
Runs on centos 7, should also work from el7

Contents:

* build.sh - builds the docker image and invokes the ffmpeg compilation

* Dockerfile - defines the contents of the image

* build-ffmpeg.sh - a script to download and build ffmpeg and dependencies

* ffmpeg  - is a convenience script that runs the container & passes any additional args

Usage:

$ ./build.sh

'ffmpeg' also bind mounts the current working directory as "/data"
such that, for instance, if you have a foo.mp4 in the current directory you would
do this to convert it to webm:

$ ffmpeg -i /data/foo.mp4 /data/foo.webm
